## Week 1: Max and Audio

In the first week you’ll learn to work with Max/MSP. We’ll look at building simple systems for manipulating and playing audio in realtime, and designing graphical user interfaces.

## Week 2: Touch Boards and Recording

The second week brings in sound recording and hardware. You’ll be given audio recorders and sent out to do some field recording. Then you’ll edit these sounds and work with hardware to play them back using a touch-sensitive interface.

## Week 3: Connecting and Integrating

The first stages of putting together the complete solution. You’ll see how to connect the touch interface with Max, opening up possibilities for more sophisticated sound design and processing. And you will also investigate ideas for novel instrument design through 3D prototyping and materials.

## Week 4: Finishing and Showing

It’s showtime! You will finish implementing the instrument/Max connection, finish off the physical design, refine the audio processing, and put your finished instrument on display.
You will also need to prepare technical documentation about your design (hardware and software), and write a short (500 word) report containing some background research and outlining your design approach.
